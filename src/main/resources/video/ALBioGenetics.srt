00:00:00,351 --> 00:00:03,277
Hi everyone, welcome to Aisle. Today

2
00:00:03,277 --> 00:00:04,881
we are going to study about the

3
00:00:04,881 --> 00:00:07,086
introduction to genetics for A Level

4
00:00:07,086 --> 00:00:09,331
Biology. What is

5
00:00:09,331 --> 00:00:11,736
kinetics? Genetic is the branch of

6
00:00:11,736 --> 00:00:14,021
biology that studies he editing the

7
00:00:14,021 --> 00:00:16,347
passing of traits from one generation to

8
00:00:16,347 --> 00:00:19,073
the next. It explores the mechanism of

9
00:00:19,073 --> 00:00:21,478
inheritance and the variation of traits

10
00:00:21,478 --> 00:00:22,561
in living Organism.

11
00:00:23,844 --> 00:00:26,770
Mendelian Kinetics Gregor Mendel,

12
00:00:26,770 --> 00:00:29,737
the father of modern kinetics, formulate

13
00:00:29,737 --> 00:00:32,022
the law of inheritance based on his

14
00:00:32,062 --> 00:00:34,788
experiment with pea plants. These

15
00:00:34,788 --> 00:00:36,632
laws include the principle of.

16
00:00:37,514 --> 00:00:40,200
Segregation and independent assessment.

17
00:00:42,455 --> 00:00:44,901
Jeans, the unit of heredity, are

18
00:00:44,901 --> 00:00:47,226
segments of DNA that code for

19
00:00:47,266 --> 00:00:49,110
specific traits. The

20
00:00:49,110 --> 00:00:51,957
structure of DNA double Helix was

21
00:00:52,318 --> 00:00:54,963
elucidated by James Watson

22
00:00:54,963 --> 00:00:56,126
and Francis Creek.

23
00:00:58,411 --> 00:01:00,777
Games are organized on chromosomes

24
00:01:01,338 --> 00:01:04,144
tread like structure in the cell nucleus.

25
00:01:04,505 --> 00:01:07,191
The complete set of genetic material in

26
00:01:07,191 --> 00:01:09,276
an Organism is its genome.

27
00:01:10,899 --> 00:01:13,305
Genetic variants arise through processes

28
00:01:13,305 --> 00:01:15,790
such as mutation, recombination and

29
00:01:15,790 --> 00:01:18,516
sexual reproduction. It

30
00:01:18,556 --> 00:01:20,721
contributes to the diversity observed

31
00:01:20,721 --> 00:01:21,924
within species.

32
00:01:23,778 --> 00:01:26,264
Advances in molecular biology and

33
00:01:26,264 --> 00:01:28,870
biotechnology have evolutionary

34
00:01:28,910 --> 00:01:31,435
genetics. Techniques

35
00:01:31,997 --> 00:01:34,643
like DNA sequencing and gene

36
00:01:34,643 --> 00:01:37,289
editing enable precise manipulation of

37
00:01:37,289 --> 00:01:40,135
genes. Genetic

38
00:01:40,135 --> 00:01:42,139
engineering involves modifying an

39
00:01:42,139 --> 00:01:44,785
organism's DNA to achieve desired

40
00:01:44,785 --> 00:01:47,311
threats. Applications including

41
00:01:47,351 --> 00:01:50,157
agriculture, medicine and biotechnology.

42
00:01:52,212 --> 00:01:55,018
Ongoing research in genetics continues to

43
00:01:55,219 --> 00:01:57,624
unravel in complexities of

44
00:01:57,624 --> 00:01:59,990
inheritance, evolution and the

45
00:01:59,990 --> 00:02:02,746
molecular basis of life. The

46
00:02:02,746 --> 00:02:05,592
fatehouse promised for addressing

47
00:02:05,592 --> 00:02:07,998
global challenges in health, agriculture

48
00:02:07,998 --> 00:02:10,804
and conservation. In

49
00:02:10,804 --> 00:02:12,488
this video we have covered the

50
00:02:12,488 --> 00:02:15,093
introduction to genetics, Mendelian

51
00:02:15,093 --> 00:02:17,980
genetics and DNA and genes, and

52
00:02:17,980 --> 00:02:20,265
the introduction to chromosomes and

53
00:02:20,265 --> 00:02:22,390
genomes Genetic.

54
00:02:23,562 --> 00:02:25,166
Variations and the modern kinetics and

55
00:02:25,326 --> 00:02:27,852
genetic engineering and also the future

56
00:02:27,852 --> 00:02:30,769
direction of genetics. I

57
00:02:30,769 --> 00:02:32,893
think you have a clear understanding

58
00:02:32,893 --> 00:02:34,657
about the basic

59
00:02:35,219 --> 00:02:37,825
introduction to genetics. I

60
00:02:37,905 --> 00:02:40,671
